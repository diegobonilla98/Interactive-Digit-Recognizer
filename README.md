# Interactive-Digit-Recognizer
Interactive digit recognition using pygame and keras


Using a Neural Network and the typical MNIST dataset, I've trained a model and saved it so when drawing a new digit it tries to recognize it.

WHEN FAILING:
- Try to simulate the MNIST number for the best accuracy.
- Redraw lines making them a couple of pixels wide.
